# Private Password Manager

Version 0.1.6

You can use this application to store your passwords. Place, username, password, and remark columns are available. The software automatically updates itself. This endeavor was designed for a small group of individuals, so you cannot simply manage it. You must first activate the software before downloading and using it; otherwise, it won't function.

Even though it's difficult, you can try to bypass it or reverse-engineer it. I am eager to see the outcomes. 

## Working

You need to first create a profile in order to access the app.
The app uses your hwid and password (Hardware Identification).
A data file becomes useless when it is moved to another machine. 

## Features

- 4 themes (green, blue, yellow, red)
- password changing option
- time lock (5 min)
